"""Write a function on_all that applies a function to every element of a list. Use it to print the first twenty perfect squares. The perfect squares can be found by multiplying each natural number with itself. The first few perfect squares are 1*1= 1, 2*2=4, 3*3=9, 4*4=16. Twelve for example is not a perfect square because there is no natural number m so that m*m=12.
(This question is tricky if your programming language makes it difficult to pass functions as arguments.)"""
